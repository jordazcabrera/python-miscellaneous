# call bashrc file from within this file
# this code is saying, if .bashrc exists, then execute that code in the file
# what happend is that as soon as we open up a login shell, and it runs this piece of code, which runs the .bashrc file.
# and if you run a sub-shell, it is also going to run the .bashrc file. now, we can add all our customization to the .bashrc file
# and not really have to worry about the .bash_profile file anymore.

#GET RID OF THE CUZTOMIZATION
#you can just remove the statement above. we don't want to remove the file since it has a path for mysql. if there was nothing else then we can move it to anothere directory, doing:
#josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ mv .bashrc DotFiles/
#also we have to move .bash_profile, josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ mv .bash_profile DotFiles/
