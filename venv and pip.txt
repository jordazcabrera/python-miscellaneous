#########  INSTALL HOMEBREW ######### 

josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"


#########  INSTALL PYTHON ######### 

josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ brew install python     ----> by default installs python3
josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.6
josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ python --version
Python 2.7.16


######### CREATING A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT ######### 

venv (for Python 3) and virtualenv (for Python 2) allow you to manage separate package installations for different projects. 
They essentially allow you to create a “virtual” isolated Python installation and install packages into that virtual installation. 
When you switch projects, you can simply create a new virtual environment and not have to worry about breaking the packages 
installed in the other environments.


#########  CREATE/ACTIVATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT CALLED ETHEL IN THE PROJECT'S DIRECTORY PycharmProjects ######### 

josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ python3 -m venv PycharmProjects/ethel

josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ source PycharmProjects/ethel/bin/activate        --->  if you are already in  PycharmProjects directory, source ethel/bin/activate
(ethel) 										
josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ which python
/Users/josemanuel/PycharmProjects/ethel/bin/python
(ethel) 
josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ deactivate


#########  ACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE MY VENV THAT WAS CREATED AUTOMATICALLY WHEN CREATING THE DIRECTORY HELLOWORLD IN PYCHARM ######### 

josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ source PycharmProjects/HelloWorld/venv/bin/activate
(venv) 
josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.6
(venv) 
josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ python2 --version
Python 2.7.16
(venv) 
josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ deactivate


########### PIP VS PIP3 ########### 

pip3, which is the package manager of python3, is installed along with python3 by Homebrew. And as for pip, you can install it.

If you had python 2.x and then installed python3, your pip will be pointing to pip3. 
you can verify that by typing pip --version which would be the same as pip3 --version.

THIS IS IN MY MACHINE 
josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ pip3 -V (or --version)
pip 19.3.1 from /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)

josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ pip --version (or -V)
-bash: pip: command not found


THIS IS IN ethel VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
josemanuel at Joses-MacBook-Pro in ~$ pip -V
pip 19.2.3 from /Users/josemanuel/PycharmProjects/ethel/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pip (python 3.7)
