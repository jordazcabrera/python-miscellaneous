this is a brief how-to on sending your work and how it will be scored. the action happens on hills. to turn in a program -- let's call it homework.py (the name doesn't matter) -- you could use this command:

  $ ~abrick/send homework.py

a lot of things can potentially go wrong here, so read the program's response carefully to see if the submission worked. on this topic see the course policies on "assignments".

next week, when there are for the first time homeworks to review, to get your peer review assignments you will also run this program:

  $ ~abrick/tally

in future weeks, "tally" will also display the peer review comments you receive. you will review peer work by creating a peer review file -- let's call it reviews.pr (the name doesn't matter) -- and submitting it by using ~abrick/send in the same way as above. on this topic see the course policies on "peer review".
